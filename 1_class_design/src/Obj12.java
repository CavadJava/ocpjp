/**
    2. Implement inheritance including visibility modifiers and composition

    This topic covers IS-A and HAS-A relationships.
    Composition just means a class has an object for an instance variable.

    Favour composition over inheritance, unless you really want polymorphic behaviour.

    Note: there is little source code here, as covered in OCAJP
